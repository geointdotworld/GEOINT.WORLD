# GEOINT.WORLD

Open-source geospatial intelligence platform for real-time monitoring of aviation, maritime, space, communications infrastructure, and global events.

## Overview

GEOINT.WORLD is a web-based situational awareness tool that aggregates and visualizes real-time data from multiple open-source intelligence feeds. The platform provides a unified interface for tracking aircraft, ships, satellites, mesh networks, submarine cables, news events, and prediction markets.

## Features

### Aviation
- Real-time ADS-B flight tracking via OpenSky Network and ADSB.LOL
- Emergency squawk code detection (7700, 7600, 7500, SPI)
- Military, PIA, and LADD aircraft monitoring
- Altitude filtering and custom squawk code search

### Maritime
- Global vessel tracking via AIS telemetry
- Dark fleet monitoring (AIS gap visualization)
- Fishing activity, loitering, and encounter detection
- Global Fishing Watch integration

### Space
- Satellite orbital tracking using SGP4 propagation
- TLE data from CelesTrak (NORAD)
- Starlink, GPS, ISS, and debris monitoring
- Real-time position calculation in browser

### Communications
- Radio station mapping (AM/FM/Shortwave)
- Radio repeater locations
- LoRa mesh network nodes (Meshtastic/Meshcore)
- Submarine cable infrastructure mapping

### Intelligence Feeds
- GDELT news feed with keyword filtering
- Polymarket prediction markets for geopolitical events
- USGS earthquake data visualization

### Blockchain Integration
- Solana-based inscription system for data permanence
- $GEOINT token planned for Phase III

### Data Sources
- OpenSky Network (Aviation)
- ADSB.LOL (Uncensored Aircraft)
- Global Fishing Watch (Maritime)
- CelesTrak (Satellite TLE)
- MeshMap/Meshcore (LoRa)
- Telegeography (Submarine Cables)
- GDELT Project (News)
