# GEOINT.WORLD

Open-source geospatial intelligence platform for real-time monitoring of aviation, maritime, space, and global events on a unified map interface.

## Overview

GEOINT.WORLD aggregates real-time data from multiple open-source intelligence feeds into a single, searchable situational awareness interface. Track aircraft, vessels, satellites, communications infrastructure, and global events with streaming data and permanent blockchain archival.

## Features

**Aviation** – Real-time ADS-B flight tracking, emergency squawk detection (7700/7600/7500), military aircraft monitoring, altitude filtering

**Maritime** – Global vessel tracking, dark fleet monitoring, fishing activity detection, Global Fishing Watch integration

**Space** – Satellite orbital tracking (Starlink, GPS, ISS, debris), SGP4 propagation, CelesTrak TLE data

**Communications** – Radio station mapping, mesh network nodes (Meshtastic), submarine cable infrastructure

**Intelligence** – GDELT news feeds, Polymarket prediction markets, USGS earthquake data

**Blockchain** – Solana-based data inscription for permanent archival (Phase III: $GEOINT token)

## Getting Started

Requires WebGL and modern JavaScript. Full documentation available in `/docs/`.

## Roadmap

- **Phase I** – Core infrastructure & real-time visualization
- **Phase II** – Signal analytics & pattern detection
- **Phase III** – $GEOINT tokenization & inscription system
- **Phase IV** – Additional data sources & advanced analytics

## Data Sources

OpenSky Network, ADSB.LOL, Global Fishing Watch, CelesTrak, Meshtastic, Telegeography, GDELT, Polymarket, USGS
